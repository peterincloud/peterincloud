Hi, I’m @peterincloud Or Peter Lloyd Rufus.

Throughout my career, I have worked on a diverse set of enterprise level and full SDLC projects in organizations such as Thomson Reuters, Federal Aviation Authority (through Tetra Tech Corporation), and Harris Corporation. 
My skill-set includes Asp.Net and .Net Core, MVC, RESTful Web Services, Azure platform development, Azure SQL and Cosmos on the middle tier and jQuery, React.js, Kendo UI on the front-end. I have extensive experience with the Agile development methodology and SCRUM practices as well as dealing with the flux of priorities and demands typical to any complex software project. 

But working with diverse technologies is my expertise. Some include Five9, Boberdoo, Yahoo, Zillow B2B frameworks to Google, Microsoft Azure, propriatary SNS SaaS and PaaS platforms. I thrive with the challenges of making disparate systems work together.

For the last few years, I’ve been interested in and have been coding Microsoft Azure Compute Services, meaning App and Cloud Services, Function Apps and the Azure Service Fabric. I'm now looking into Azure AI Services, Bot Services and Machine Learning. In my free time, I’m currently learning Python and React.js. I’m also looking to collaborate on Machine Learning on Azure as well as Python Data Science applications. 
So let me know if you are interested in any of these projects and we can connect.
